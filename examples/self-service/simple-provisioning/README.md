This pipeline use the Jenkins generic webhook trigger plugin to listen events generated by Apwide Golive.

You must have configured [jira webhook](https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/managing-webhooks-938846912.html) first and
then, use [Jenkins generic webhook trigger plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Generic+Webhook+Trigger+Plugin) to select
which trigger you want to put in place.

If you want to be able to trigger a specific build on specific trigger, you will have to define a **token** that needs to be configured
at job trigger level and on the webhook url query parameter. Consult the jenkins plugin documentation to see how to proceed.

Apwide golive provides these events:
* environment:created
* environment:updated
* environment:deleted
* environment:version_deployed
* environment:status_updated
* environment:env_customfield_value_added
* environment:env_customfield_value_removed

In this example, pipeline listens to **environment:created** for provisioning the environment and **environment:version_deployed**
to trigger a new version deployment.
