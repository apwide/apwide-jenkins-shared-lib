## Advanced selection of environments to monitor

You have used Apwide Golive environment attributes to provide additional information on your environments and you can use them to create groups of environment.
For example, environment could be managed by a specific team.

In this pipeline, we select environments to monitor using the [Apwide Golive Environment Search API](https://confluence.apwide.com/display/TEM/Search+Environments)
We provide search criteria directly on the monitor step and Apwide Golive will use it to select environments and check their status.
